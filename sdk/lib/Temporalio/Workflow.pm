=head1 NAME

Temporalio::Workflow - entry point for workflow authors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use feature 'class';
    use Future::AsyncAwait;
    use Temporalio::Workflow;

    class My::Workflow::Greeting :isa(Temporalio::Workflow::Definition) {
        async method run :Run ($name) {
            return "Hello, $name!";
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<use Temporalio::Workflow;> in a workflow module loads
L<Temporalio::Workflow::Definition> so the C<:isa> base resolves and the
C<:Run>/C<:Signal>/C<:Query>/C<:Update>/C<:Init> attribute handlers are in
scope. The workflow-context functional surface (C<Temporalio::Workflow::now>,
C<execute_activity>, etc. — spec section 10.2) is added in a later phase.
